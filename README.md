# Code Snippet Saver (web version)
This is a simple app to save various code snippets and reference them later. When you come across a useful, reusable block of code, this app can save it for future reference. 

This is the web-based version of this app. A terminal app with the same functionality is in the works, which will sync with the same database and automatically copy the code snippet you are looking for to your clipboard. Coming soon. [GitHub Repo](https://www.github.com/adnanyousef/save)
